# Nanny+

Nanny+ makes it easy to enter data, track hours worked, invoice, and keep accounting records for nannies.

With the Nanny+ (or Nanny Plus) application, it is very simple to manage your childcare activity.

Create your files, with important information about the children you look after: first and last names of course, but also known allergies and an emergency contact number.

For each child, note down your hours worked, as well as the fixed price services that you offer. You can of course create as many services or packages as you wish.

At any time, draw up an invoice for one or more of the children you look after. These invoices are available in PDF format and can be shared with parents via instant messaging or email, downloaded for your archives, or simply printed directly from your phone with a compatible printer.

Of course, you can customise the look of your invoices by choosing a logo from your photo gallery, indicating the name of your childcare facility, as well as your payment terms and bank details.

Nanny+ is a completely free application, requiring no subscription and with no in-app purchases. There are no advertisements in the application either.

The data is only stored on the phone. No data goes out on the Internet. Nanny+ respects your privacy and that of the children you look after.
